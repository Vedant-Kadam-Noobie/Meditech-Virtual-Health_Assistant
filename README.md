My team came in Top 11 among 75 participating teams in the 48-hour Rubix-Hackathon-22 organized by CSI-TSEC (Computer Society of India).

The problem statement was to develop Virtual Health Assistant that helps people to connect to their doctors easily and avoiding long queues, monitor their health parameters and vitals in order to live a healthy life.

I along with my teammates Mahek Karia, Pranali Shinde and Parag Patel developed a web application called MediTech.
Some key features of this project:

1. Video consultation with doctor.

2. Book an appointment with doctor for physical visit.

3. Patients can see information of medicines from the application and book lab tests.

4. E-pharmacy platform to buy medicines.

5. Online Payment Portal.
